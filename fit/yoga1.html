            <h2>History of Yoga</h2>
            <p>Yoga is an ancient practice that originated in India over 5,000 years ago. It is a holistic discipline that combines physical postures, breathing exercises, meditation, and ethical principles. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit word "yuj," which means to unite or join, symbolizing the union of body, mind, and spirit.</p>
            <p>Throughout history, yoga has evolved and diversified into various styles and schools. The earliest mentions of yoga are found in the Rig Veda, an ancient sacred text. Over the centuries, yoga was refined and developed by sages and practitioners, culminating in classical texts like the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Hatha Yoga Pradipika.</p>
